**Synopsis:** Introduces Sydney’s High Performance Computer (HPC), ‘Artemis’. We cover connecting and navigating Artemis, available software, and how to submit and monitor jobs using the PBS Pro scheduler..

**Target audience:** Students and staff who would like to learn how to run compute jobs on Artemis HPC. Participants must have a valid Sydney University Unikey.

**Follow-on courses:** This course is **part one** of the **[Artemis HPC Training Series]({{ site.series_home }})**.

This first lesson is intended as part one of a pair, with ‘_Introduction to the Artemis HPC_’ in the morning and [‘_Data transfer and RDS for HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.rds). It is recommended to register for both, however you may choose to take these courses on separate days as suits your needs.

The third course in the series, [‘_Intermediate Artemis HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/{{ site.github.repository_name }}), extends users' knowledge of the PBS Pro scheduling system, and builds scripting skills for automating large workflows on HPC.

Other [advanved research computing course (inlcuding Blockchain, GPU, Matlab)]({{ site.sih_pages }}), are optional course for users of needing specific training.

**Recorded Lesson:** You can watch the recorded lesson from April 24, 2020, here: [https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/gcmKLMZ1bsIMwAa](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/gcmKLMZ1bsIMwAa)
