## Essential Software:

To connect to Artemis HPC, and follow this lesson, you will need a ‘terminal emulator with SSH (secure shell). SSH provides encrypted communication between the your computer and a remote server, in this case Artemis. The SSH client will be invoked by the command ‘ssh’.

If you are a **Windows** users please have one of either apps below installed:

1. [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) (recommended)

2. [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) 

3. [WSL and Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview) (advanced)

If you are a **Mac** user we will be using the Terminal which comes pre-installed on your device.

For all users, if you are not on campus install and/or have your [Cisco Anyconnect VPN](https://sydneyuni.service-now.com/sm?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0011049&sys_kb_id=9e86e1a3dbdf0c50e35b89e4059619b9)
up and running. 



## Credentials to Access Artemis

You would normally use your unikey and unikey password to access Artemis. For today however, we will be using training logon credentials which are:

**Username:** ict_hpctrain<N>, with N from 1-20 (replace <N> with your assigned number)

**Password**: will be written on the whiteboard!



### Mac Logon to Artemis

Use the Terminal App. Just look for it in your Applications folder, or hit Command-Space and type ‘terminal'. Then in the terminal enter:

`ssh  <unikey>@hpc.sydney.edu.au`



### Windows Logon to Artemis

1. Open Putty.

2. Fill in the connection details:

    *Host Name*: hpc.sydney.edu.au

    *Port*: 22

    *Connection type*: SSH

3. Name this session “Artemis” and click ‘Save’



## Working on Artemis with Graphical Applications

**X11 FORWARDING**

X11 forwarding allows you to run graphical applications on a remote server and have their graphical user interfaces (GUIs) displayed on your local machine. This is particularly useful when you are working on a remote server or computer and need to run graphical applications, such as graphical text editors, web browsers, or other GUI-based tools.

To use X11 forwarding you need:

1. Mac Users:  [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) up and running, then log on to Artemis by providing the extra X flag. That is: 
`ssh -X <unikey>@hpc.sydney.edu.au`

2. Windows Users: [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) should be up and running. In PuTTY for Windows, you can enable X11 forwarding in new or saved SSH sessions by selecting *Enable X11 forwarding* in the *PuTTY Configuration* window (Connection > SSH > X11).

Alternatively for windows users, [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) offers a rich experience as a full-featured X-server and terminal emulator for ssh connections, the free version is more than adequate.

**NOMACHINE**

An alternative to X11 forwarding is to use our graphical login nodes via the NoMachine App.
These special are graphics-enabled login servers which host ‘NoMachine’, a kind of remote desktop service.

Our experience is that no-machine is preferrable when using visualisation software that rely on computation done on the HPC.

<u>To use the graphical login nodes</u>:

Download and install the [NoMachine Enterprise Client](https://pages.github.sydney.edu.au/rc/Artemis-HPC-glogin/) for your operating system. Please don’t download the client from NoMachine directly, as their current version may not work with Artemis.

If you’re using MacOS, you need to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org).

Download the [glogin.nxs](https://pages.github.sydney.edu.au/rc/Artemis-HPC-glogin/glogin.nxs) session file to your computer.

To connect:

Double-click or run the glogin.nxs shortcut you downloaded (it will open NoMachine Client).
A NoMachine window should start, asking for a username and password.
Replace “YOUR_UNIKEY” with your UniKey, then enter your UniKey password in the password field, then click ‘OK’.
A short while later, an Artemis terminal window should open.
