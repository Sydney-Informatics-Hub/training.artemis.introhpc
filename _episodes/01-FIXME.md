This episode introduces the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/), and FIXME.


# The Sydney Informatics Hub

The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a _[Core Research Facility](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities.html)_ of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individual Faculties to purchase and maintain. The classic example might be the room-size electron-microscopes, built into specialised rooms in the Sydney Microscopy & Microanalysis unit.

**Artemis HPC** itself is a multi-million dollar set of equipment, a 'supercomputer', is the main piece of equipment supported by SIH. However, we also provide a wide range of research services to aid investigators, such as

* [Training](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/training/)
* [Statistics Consulting](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/services/statistics/)
* Modeling/Simulation/Visualisation consulting and [platforms](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/services/artemis/)
* [Bioinformatics](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/services/bioinformatics/) consulting
* [Research Data Management](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/rdm/) Consulting and platforms
* [Data Science & Research Engineering](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/services/data-science/) project work

We also aim to cultivate a **data community** at USyd, organising monthly [Hacky Hours](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/hackyhour/), outside training events (eg NVIDIA, Pawsey Center), [conferences](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/hpc_conference/), and data/coding-related events. We are currently running an quarterly [Publication Incentive](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/news/sihincentive/) contest, with $2000 worth of prizes for the winning peer-reviewed publications submitted to us, which both use our services _and_ acknowledge them.
