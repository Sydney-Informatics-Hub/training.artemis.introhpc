| [Introduction to the Research Data Store and Data Transfer](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/training.artemis.rds) |  Learn how to transfer data between your local computer, external sources, the University's Research Data Store (RDS) and Artemis HPC. |
|[Intermediate Artemis HPC](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/training.artemis.interhpc) | Learn how to automate multiple-run analyses with job arrays and do simple bash scripting on Artemis. The live training consists of two hours of instruction and practical exercises. |
|[Matlab on Artemis: The MDCS](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/training.artemis.mdcs) | Artemis HPC hosts a Matlab Distributed Computing Server (MDCS) - this allows users to submit MATLAB jobs directly to Artemis from within their local Matlab instance on their machines. Come and learn how to use this service. |
